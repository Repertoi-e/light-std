Project structure
- vendor
- common functions with no crt
- decouple lstd and lstd-graphics
  This would probably involve somehow managing a linker table
  with functions that should run with the initialization of the lstd.
  This would be flexible enough to allow easily adding new modules
  just by linking with them and even allow the user to add their own routines.
  
- Simplify signal.h
  
- make it MODULES, hehe
       This is probably going to be the biggest restructure this project has even seen.
	   
- Constexpr allocations, fully constexpr string, array, etc.
	 
- Make monitors and cursors handles (like window).
  Typedef them to void * and move all functions outside? There is really no need for a class. 
	   
	   
// They are provided in a file called "common_standard_library_functions.h".
	  
	  
	  
- More robust memory model for stuff the library allocates (see note in premake5.lua)
	
	Save even mOrE info and make an awesome memory viewer,
	so you can see what your program is doing.
	
	Also profiler in the future?
	
- common.h: @TODO: Merge using is_constant_evaluated()
	
- Rename free to dispose when referring to object cleanup,
  right now we are calling "free" on stack objects which may confused the heck out of people.
	
- I have finally decided... We don't like references. Don't use references anywhere in the code. Huge cleanup incoming! 
	
- Rename os to lstd.os and path to lstd.path,
  
  
  
- File reading API (currently we have two functions, is that enough?)
  At least file_writer...
- Also file mapping


- Fix check stack 

fmt module:
- Printable code point
- Escaping (+ unicode) - this would cerror reporting in the default error function
- Digit grouping
- Locale
- printf-like format string parsing (because it is used so commonly)
- Check arguments at compile time

math module:
- Make it C++20
- Actually remove it all together


README.md:
- Build section
- Section about attributions



- API for watching directory changes
  ... and an asset catalog system


Tests with parse_guid_options


String iterator doesn't work with constexpr


// @TODO: Potentially useful?
// bool BasePrefixCountedTowardsMaxDigits = true;
// bool ByteToDigitIgnoreThisByteCountedTowardsMaxDigits = true; 


concept Hashable and speed up hasher


----------------- Things not hapenning for a while probably:

- Time module?    
- Random module?
- Regex module?

Data structures and lock-free data structures

Allow users to add more variables to Implicit_Context

Implement platform specific functionality and compile on linux.
(This is probably never going to happen if I continue to work on this alone LMAO)
