I modified the source code of premake in order to treat .cppm and .ixx files as
module files for C++20 (otherwise they don't get included in the build process).

For now this concerns only Visual Studio since other compilers don't support C++20.

I have provided a prebuilt binary in vendor/Windows/premake5.exe as to keep the
build process as simple and dependency free as possible.
