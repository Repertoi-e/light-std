//
// See the following papers for more information on the algorithm:
//  "How to Print Floating-Point Numbers Accurately"
//    Steele and White
//    http://kurtstephens.com/files/p372-steele.pdf

//    Burger and Dybvig
//    http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.72.4656

// 
// It is a modified version of numpy's dragon4 implementation,
// ... which is a modification of Ryan Juckett's version.
